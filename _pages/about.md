I'm an automation-focused Data Analyst who specializes in eliminating inefficiencies and delivering measurable business impact. Whether it's crafting a complex SQL query or automating reports with Python, I love the challenge and the "aha" moment when everything clicks. At my previous company, I single-handedly built reporting workflows that reduced manual processes by 85%—essentially delivering the output of a multi-person team through strategic automation with SQL, Python, and Power BI.

I thrive in high-stakes environments where data accuracy matters. From automating sleep study validation workflows in healthcare to building KPI systems that drive leadership decisions, I focus on turning complex technical problems into reliable, scalable solutions that non-technical stakeholders can trust. My approach blends technical execution (SQL Server, Python, ETL pipelines) with cross-functional communication, and I've worked in regulated industries like healthcare and insurance where compliance and data integrity are mission-critical.

I'm a Microsoft-certified Data Science professional and always exploring new ways to apply analytics. I'm currently working on a side project analyzing age-impact trends in Phillies player performance (because if I have to watch them break my heart every season, I might as well turn it into a predictive model). Outside of data, you'll find me cheering for the Eagles and Phillies, playing clarinet for 30+ years, reading, and hunting for the best coffee shops.
